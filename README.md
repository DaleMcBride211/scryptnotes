Project Overview

SCRYPT

Scrypt is a modern note-taking application. Leveraging the power of Google's Gemini API, Scrypt allows users to rephrase their notes without ever leaving the app. Built with Next.js for a fast, server-rendered experience and styled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui for a sleek, responsive design, Scrypt offers full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality backed by MongoDB for persistent data storage.

Implemented robust CRUD functionality allowing for seamless note creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion. This involved designing and connecting the frontend interface with the MongoDB backend operations.

Integrated the Google Gemini API to provide users with an innovative AI-powered text rephrasing tool directly within the note-taking interface. This involved handling API requests, managing responses, and updating the UI dynamically.

Developed a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and the Shadcn/ui component library, focusing on intuitive navigation and a pleasant user experience.
